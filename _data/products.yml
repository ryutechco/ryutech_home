                    <h2>THE EVOLUTION OF RAPID AUXILIARY MODULES FROM 1995 TO TODAY</h2>

                    <p>
                        Dimsport's Rapid plug&amp;play modules are a solid solution for the optimisation of turbo-diesel and turbo-petrol engines, embracing a very diverse range of needs, from the need for increased torque-power to fuel consumption optimisation in cars, trucks, tractors and boats.
                    </p>

                    <h2>FROM THE FIRST ANALOGUE MODULES...</h2>

                    <p>
                        The path taken in 1995 with the first analogue products, continued with the launch of the first digital LPI platforms for turbo-diesel engines in 2004. Pressure optimisation developed alongside this, as did the management of injection times, thus diversifying products for different applications. This led to the creation of winning XTI platforms (trucks and tractors), LPDs (Toyota) and BHV (BMW and other brands).

                    <h2>...TO A BRAND NEW ‘RAPID 2.0’ PLATFORM</h2>

                    <p>
                        2014 saw the birth of the TPM technology platform, which initially focused exclusively on turbo-petrol engines and came with a professional fine-tuning software that accompanies the "legendary" calibration console.<br>
                        In 2016 TPM technology was extended to turbo-diesel engines in order to maintain the high optimisation level guaranteed by DIMSPORT in new-generation cars too.

                    <p>
                        Every Rapid module is Made in Italy.

            <p>Rapid TPM: a new platform for cars with turbo-diesel and turbo-petrol engines</p>

            <p>
                Rapid TPM (Turbo Power Management) is DIMSPORT's latest technological innovation. It is a new generation platform that is able to handle turbo-diesel and turbo-petrol engines. The new module is equipped with a microprocessor, FLASH eprom and RAM eeprom so as to gain full control of the relevant pressure sensors; these are also able to control some signals sent from the CAN BUS line of the vehicle's original electronic control units.
            </p>

            <p>
                All Rapid modules were developed with a view to keeping unchanged the safety and protection features of the original engine control unit, such as the self-adapting functions of the vehicle's electronic system and the monitoring of critical parameters relating to engine function. Some wirings are already designed to work with communication protocol SAE J2716 SENT.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Turbo-petrol</b>

            <p>
                <img src='./images/add-on-01.png' style='float:right'>
                The world of cars has evolved giving new space to supercharged Petrol engines, which are increasingly common in small to medium-sized vehicles. The approach chosen for Rapid TPM allows for customised engine function, by analysing various signals such as air flow, intake manifold pressure, turbo pressure and engine RPM.
            </p>

            <p>
                The platform is linked directly to the sensors with plug&amp;play wiring, which is specifically designed for each compatible vehicle.

            <p>
                <b>TURBO-DIESELS</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the case of turbo-diesel engines, Rapid TPM works with the signal sent by the rail pressure sensor in a simple and efficient way; in addition to this, the pressure in the intake manifold can also be altered in order to manage the turbo, using engine RPM as well as any additional signals that may have been sent from the CAN line as a reference.

            </p>

            <p>
                TPM modules are the same for all applications: The choice of Specific wiring and the writing of custom-made firmware using the TPM Software, allows for the creation of a customised kit for the required application, with the added benefit of standard calibration provided by DIMSPORT and a professional tool for even finer tuning of the vehicle in real time.

            <p>
                Besides the TPM platform, Rapid offers a range of successful products made exclusively for Turbo Diesel engines.
            </p>

            <p>
                This product range is available for cars, commercial vehicles, trucks, tractors and boats. All modules were developed with a view to keeping unchanged the safety and protection features of the vehicle's original electronic control unit, such as the self-adapting functions of the vehicle's electronic system, the management of the diesel particulate filter and the monitoring of critical parameters relating to engine function.

            <p>
                <b>CONNECTORS ARE AS SAFE AS ORIGINAL ONES</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Over 80% of applications in the catalogue use automotive wiring and connectors that are compatible with those fitted in original vehicles, guaranteeing a 'clean' and safe installation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>STANDARD ELECTRONICS ARE NOT A PROBLEM</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Rapid avoids malfunctions and problems during the diagnosis phase by leaving it up to the standard electronic control unit to monitor vital safety parameters for the correct functioning of the mechanics.
            </p>

            <p><b>REAL-TIME FINE-TUNING</b></p>

            <p>
                The parameters of all Rapid modules can be optimised either on the road or on the power test bench, through the calibration console or the TPM ADVANCED software, giving the user real time feedback on the task carried out.
            </p>

            <p><b>WHAT ABOUT YOUR DEVELOPMENT WORK? IT'S TOTALLY SAFE!</b></p>

            <p>
                The software's special MAP LOCK function makes it possible to pause the reading process for parameters saved in the module, protecting your fine-tuning work and preserving your precious know-how.
            </p>

            <p><b>CHANGE CAR, NOT THE AUXILIARY MODULE</b></p>

            <p>
                Interchangeable wiring makes it possible for the Rapid auxiliary module to be reused on more than one vehicle: all it takes is a few clicks to update the firmware!

        <p>
            Race Evo software joins the diagnostic tools already in use in the workshops, allowing the operator to carry out targeted operations on individual trouble codes stored in the engine control unit reducing intervention time and costs. Race Evo ‘Options’ act in the core of the problem helping Professionals to selectively operate only when needed, even avoiding end customers to have an entire package of components replaced, in some cases.

                    Dynamometers are used in Tuning and measurement of Power for automotive industries. There are many types of dynamometer in the market. What we offer is a quad roller rolling road dynamometer. The power is measured from the torque at the wheel corresponding to the RPM. For tuning, the dynamometer gives the feedback to tuners on the performances of the engine real time at any given target loads or full power run. The dyno is equipped with electromagnetic brake (retarder) that can varies the load at any given rpm to give the precise load simulation as if the car is run on real roads.
