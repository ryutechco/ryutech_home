            Engine tuning has a long history since the first days of motorsport. In the old days, engine tuning has to be done mechanically and by mechanics. The engines in that time were completely controlled by mechanical links. The alterations have to give more power to the engine were made mechanically eg. tightening a few screws. Nowadays, fuel injection and combustion are controlled using an Engine Control Unit (ECU). To tune the engine for more power output, the parameters that the ECU uses to control such system has to be adjusted. Usually the timing, duration, pressure, and limiting factors are modified to allow the engine to output more power and torque.

            We provides ECU Remapping for OEM (Stock) ECU without having to modify or add any hardware. Remapping can be done through OBD II port, or direct access to the ECU circuit board. The safest and easiest way to tune ECU is via OBD II port. Both method uses specialised tool to safely modify the contents of ECU. We use a professional tuning software, Race EVO, to make sure that the modifications are safe. We offer a wide range of ECU Remapping for Cars, Pickups, Trucks, and Bikes. There are three packages that we offer, Tailored Tuning, Performance Package, and Economy Package.

            This type of tuning requires a lot of time, up to 6 hours. In an extreme cases, this might means several visits and tunes. If required, we will be able to do final touches at race tracks.

            Note: Accident and engine failures are often the results of pushing the engine too close to its limits.
