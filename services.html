            Engine tuning has a long history since the first days of motorsport. In the old days, engine tuning has to be done mechanically and by mechanics. The engines in that time were completely controlled by mechanical links. The alterations have to give more power to the engine were made mechanically eg. tightening a few screws. Nowadays, fuel injection and combustion are controlled using an Engine Control Unit (ECU). To tune the engine for more power output, the parameters that the ECU uses to control such system has to be adjusted. Usually the timing, duration, pressure, and limiting factors are modified to allow the engine to output more power and torque.

          <p>
            We provides ECU Remapping for OEM (Stock) ECU without having to modify or add any hardware. Remapping can be done through OBD II port, or direct access to the ECU circuit board. The safest and easiest way to tune ECU is via OBD II port. Both method uses specialised tool to safely modify the contents of ECU. We use a professional tuning software, Race EVO, to make sure that the modifications are safe. We offer a wide range of ECU Remapping for Cars, Pickups, Trucks, and Bikes. There are three packages that we offer, Tailored Tuning, Performance Package, and Economy Package.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also provides Standalone ECU tuning, such as MoTeC for motorsports competition race car. With our precision adaptive load dynamometer from Dyno Developments, we are able to tune precisely at all load points to give the best drivability for racers. We will be able to detect any faults and flaws of the engine system in race car on our dynamometer.

              We are open to any requirements to suit your driving style, target power, or specific modifications. We will discuss the requirements with you to best match our tuning points. Your modifications to the car should be mentioned to us, this is for us to set the safety limits and realistic goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This type of tuning requires a lot of time, up to 6 hours. In an extreme cases, this might means several visits and tunes. If required, we will be able to do final touches at race tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: Accident and engine failures are often the results of pushing the engine too close to its limits.

              Our Performance Package is designed to allow the engine to have higher output and quicker throttle response while maintaining vehicle’s OEM maintenance schedule. This suits you if you want to enjoy the extra power from the engine on your daily drive vehicle.This is available for Petrol (N/A, and Turbo), and Diesel (N/A, and Turbo) models.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we often test the performances at our facility, we also have our partners tested the safe performance gains on each model so that the tested list keeps up to date. We are more than happy to develop a performance package for your model if it’s not already on the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: N/A engines usually does not gain as much as Turbo engines.

            <p>
              Our Economy Package is designed for saving fuel consumption and maximize the efficiency of the engine while maintaining vehicle’s OEM maintenance schedule. Often times, this means having more low-end torque and better response. We don’t trade off drivability and stock power for fuel consumption. This is available for Petrol (N/A, and Turbo), and Diesel (N/A, and Turbo) models.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though our Economy Package improves the efficiency of the engine, saving fuel rely heavily on your driving behavior. Saving fuel has to be measured over time in corresponding with driving style, and road conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: Saving fuel varies from car to car, and driver to driver.
